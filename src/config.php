    The important thing to realize is that the config file should be included in every

    This allows you to confidently use these settings throughout a project because
    if something changes such as your database credentials, or a path to a specific resource,
    you'll only need to update it here.

Added this line to keep everything to resolving to localhost in order access web interface from a different machine.  
The interface name after if config needs to be changed to whatever works for your system, usually eth0.
I am sure there are much cleaner ways of getting the local value, but I am not super skilled in PHP
Changed the URL in line 62 and 64
